# Schubert's dotfiles (inspired by Paul Irish's dotfiles)

[mathias's readme](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) is awesome. go read it.

## install the necessary apps

My basic setup is captured in `install-deps.sh` (`install-deps-el.sh` for EL) which adds homebrew (OS X only), z, nave, etc.

## private config

Toss it into a file called `.extra` which you do not commit to this repo and just keep in your `~/`

## Syntax highlighting

â€¦is really important. even for these files.

Install [Dotfiles Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/mattbanks/dotfiles-syntax-highlighting-st2) via [Sublime Text 2 Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)


### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```

## Similar projects

I recommend getting a [`.jshintrc`](https://github.com/jshint/node-jshint/blob/master/.jshintrc) and [`.editorconfig`](http://editorconfig.org/) defined for all your projects.
