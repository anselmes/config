# Schubert's dotfiles (inspired by Paul Irish's dotfiles)

[mathias's readme](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) is awesome. go read it.

## Install the necessary apps
My basic setup is captured in `install-deps.sh` (`install-deps-el.sh` for EL) which adds homebrew (OS X only), z, nave, etc.

## Private config
Toss it into a file called `.extra` which you do not commit to this repo and just keep in your `~/`

## Syntax highlighting
â€¦is really important. even for these files.
Install [Dotfiles Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/mattbanks/dotfiles-syntax-highlighting-st2) via [Sublime Text 2 Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)

## Similar projects
I recommend getting a [`.jshintrc`](https://github.com/jshint/node-jshint/blob/master/.jshintrc) and [`.editorconfig`](http://editorconfig.org/) defined for all your projects.

## Overview of files

####  Automatic config
* `.ackrc` - for ack (better than grep)
* `.vimrc`, `.vim` - vim config
* `brew.sh` - homebrew initialization (OS X only)
* `spf13-vim.sh` - vim spf13

#### Shell environment
* `.bashrc`
* `.extra` - not included, explained above
* `.vimrc.local` - local vimrc
* `.profile`
* `profile`
* `profile-el`
* `profile.d`

#### Manual run
* `install-deps.sh` - random apps I need installed (OS X)
* `install-deps-el.sh` - random apps I need installed (EL)

#### Git
* `.git`
* `.gitconfig`
* `.gitignore`
* `.inputrc` - config for bash readline

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanselme/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./install-deps (./install-deps-el for EL) && ./sync.sh
```

To update later on, just run the sync again.
