# CFSSL Certificate Authority Configuration
# This configuration file defines the settings for creating a Certificate Authority (CA)
# hierarchy using CloudFlare's CFSSL toolkit. It establishes a root CA and intermediate CA
# structure for secure certificate management in distributed systems.
#
# Structure:
# - Root CA: Self-signed certificate at the top of the trust chain
# - Intermediate CA: Signed by root CA, used for issuing end-entity certificates
# - Certificate profiles: Define usage patterns and validity periods
#
# Use cases:
# - Kubernetes cluster certificate management
# - Internal service TLS certificates
# - Client certificate authentication
# - Code signing certificates
#
# Security considerations:
# - Root CA private key should be stored offline after intermediate CA creation
# - Intermediate CA handles day-to-day certificate issuance
# - Regular certificate rotation and monitoring recommended
#
# Prerequisites:
# - CFSSL and CFSSLJSON tools installed
# - Secure storage for private keys
# - Network access for certificate distribution
#
# Usage:
#   # Generate root CA
#   cfssl genkey -initca cert.yaml | cfssljson -bare ca
#
#   # Generate intermediate CA
#   cfssl gencert -ca ca.pem -ca-key ca-key.pem cert.yaml | cfssljson -bare intermediate

# Global configuration for certificate signing operations
config:
  # Default signing configuration applied to all certificate operations
  signing:
    # Default certificate parameters when no specific profile is used
    default:
      expiry: 8760h  # Certificate validity period: 1 year (365 days * 24 hours)

    # Certificate profiles define specific use cases and constraints
    profiles:
      # Intermediate CA profile for creating subordinate certificate authorities
      intermediate:
        expiry: 8700h  # Slightly shorter than default to ensure renewal before root expires

        # Key usage extensions define what the certificate can be used for
        usages:
          - cert sign         # Can sign certificates (CA capability)
          - crl sign          # Can sign Certificate Revocation Lists

        # CA constraints define certificate authority capabilities
        ca_constraint:
          is_ca: true  # Mark this certificate as a Certificate Authority

# Root Certificate Authority configuration
# The root CA is the trust anchor for the entire certificate hierarchy
ca:
  CN: Root CA  # Common Name: identifies the certificate authority

  # Private key configuration for the root CA
  key:
    algo: rsa   # Algorithm: RSA (alternatives: ecdsa)
    size: 4096  # Key size: 4096 bits for strong security (minimum 2048)

  # Distinguished Name components for the root CA certificate
  names:
    - C: CA                        # Country: Canada
      L: ON                        # Locality: Ontario
      ST: Toronto                  # State/Province: Toronto
      O: OpenStack Helm            # Organization: OpenStack Helm project
      OU: Certificate Authority    # Organizational Unit: Certificate Authority division

# Intermediate Certificate Authority configuration
# The intermediate CA is used for day-to-day certificate issuance
intermediate:
  CN: Intermediate CA  # Common Name: identifies the intermediate certificate authority

  # Private key configuration for the intermediate CA
  key:
    algo: rsa   # Algorithm: RSA for compatibility
    size: 4096  # Key size: 4096 bits matching root CA security level

  # Distinguished Name components for the intermediate CA certificate
  names:
    - C: CA                        # Country: Canada (matching root CA)
      L: ON                        # Locality: Ontario (matching root CA)
      ST: Toronto                  # State/Province: Toronto (matching root CA)
      O: OpenStack Helm            # Organization: OpenStack Helm project (matching root CA)
      OU: Certificate Authority    # Organizational Unit: Certificate Authority division

# Additional certificate profiles can be added here for specific use cases:
#
# profiles:
#   server:
#     expiry: 8760h
#     usages:
#       - digital signature
#       - key encipherment
#       - server auth
#       - signing
#
#   client:
#     expiry: 8760h
#     usages:
#       - client auth
#       - digital signature
#       - key encipherment
#       - signing
#
#   peer:
#     expiry: 8760h
#     usages:
#       - signing
#       - key encipherment
#       - server auth
#       - client auth
